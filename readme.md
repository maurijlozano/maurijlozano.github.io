# MJL-Bioinformatic Scripts
This is the website of Mauricio J. Lozano developed software.
Mauricio J. Lozano is a resercher at the *Instituto de Biotecnología y Biología Molecular* (IBBM) which belongs to the National research council (CONICET) of Argentina and the National University of La Plata.
  
Mauricio's research career began with the study of early molecular determinants of the symbiosis between rhizobia and legume plants, at Antonio Lagares's LAB. He focused on molecular biology techniques aimed at the discovery of genes induced during the interaction of the symbiotic partners. During his PhD, he adapted a RIVET (Recombination based *in vivo* expression technology) approach for the study of *E. meliloti* interaction with *Medicago sativa*. Several variants were constructed, including one based on transposition.
There after, in collaboration with Dr. Eugenia Salas (a past member and PhD student at Lagares's LAB) they used STM (Signature-Tagged mutagenesis) coupled to next-generation sequencing to discover genes which mutation led to an altered root colonization competitiveness phenotype.
During this work Mauricio developed Perl scripts for the analysis of the raw sequence reads. These scripts were required for the classification of reads by mutant mixture and test condition. (STM-seq-count)[https://github.com/maurijlozano/STM-seq-count]
